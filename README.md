# Summary
Hi world, I'm Josue and I'm starting to get into computer science. I loved playing with computers since I was a kid. I remeber when I used a computer for the first time. I was in 2nd grade and I used to play flash games on an old windows xp, which was a great operating system during that time. I come from a haitian background and moved to the United States when I was 3 years old.
